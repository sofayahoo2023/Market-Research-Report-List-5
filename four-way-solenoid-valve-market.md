<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Four-Way Solenoid Valve Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct-acting Type</li><li>Sub-step Direct-acting Type</li><li>Pilot-type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The four-way solenoid valve market consists of three main types: direct-acting type, sub-step direct-acting type, and pilot-type. Direct-acting valves work by using the force generated by the solenoid coil to directly actuate the valve. Sub-step direct-acting valves operate similarly but in smaller increments. Pilot-type valves use a smaller control valve to regulate the flow of fluid through the main valve. Each type offers unique benefits in terms of efficiency, responsiveness, and control.</p></p>
