<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electrosurgery Unit Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monopole Electrosurgical Unit</li><li>Bipolar Electrosurgical Unit</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Electrosurgery Unit market includes two main types: Monopole Electrosurgical Unit and Bipolar Electrosurgical Unit. Monopole units use a single active electrode to deliver electrical energy to the tissue, while the return electrode is dispersed over a large area of the patient's body. In contrast, Bipolar units use two closely spaced electrodes to deliver energy, allowing for more precise control and reducing the risk of damage to surrounding tissue. Both types are commonly used in surgical procedures to cut, coagulate, and seal tissue.</p></p>
