<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Eco-friendly Cat Litter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-clumping</li><li>Clumping</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Eco-friendly cat litter can be divided into two main types: non-clumping and clumping. Non-clumping cat litter is typically made from natural materials like paper, wood, or grass, and absorbs moisture without forming solid clumps. It requires more frequent changing but is often biodegradable and more eco-friendly. Clumping cat litter, on the other hand, forms solid clumps when exposed to moisture, making it easier to remove waste and maintain a clean litter box. Both types are popular choices among environmentally-conscious cat owners seeking sustainable alternatives to traditional clay litter.</p></p>
