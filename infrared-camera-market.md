<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Infrared Camera Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cooled infrared detectors</li><li>Uncooled infrared detectors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In the infrared camera market, there are two main types of detectors: cooled and uncooled. Cooled infrared detectors require a cooling mechanism to maintain optimal operating temperature, which can result in higher sensitivity and better resolution. On the other hand, uncooled infrared detectors do not require cooling, making them more compact, lightweight, and cost-effective. Both types have their own advantages and target markets, with cooled detectors commonly used in military and scientific applications, while uncooled detectors are popular in commercial and consumer products.</p></p>
