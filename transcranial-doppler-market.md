<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Transcranial Doppler Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>M-mode Display</li><li>B-mode Display</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Transcranial Doppler (TCD) is a non-invasive ultrasound technique used to monitor blood flow in the brain. There are two main types of TCD displays: M-mode display and B-mode display. </p><p>M-mode display shows a single line graph representing blood flow velocity over time, allowing for precise measurements of velocity changes. </p><p>B-mode display shows a two-dimensional image of blood flow patterns, providing a more detailed visualization of blood flow within the brain. Both types of displays are important tools in diagnosing and monitoring conditions such as stroke, vasospasm, and intracranial pressure.</p></p>
