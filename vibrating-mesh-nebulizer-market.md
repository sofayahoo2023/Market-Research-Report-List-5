<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vibrating Mesh Nebulizer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Piezoelectric Actuation</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Vibrating mesh nebulizers are classified into two main types based on their actuation method: piezoelectric actuation and others. Piezoelectric actuation involves the use of piezoelectric materials that change shape when an electric current is applied, causing vibrations that aerosolize the medication. In contrast, other types of nebulizers may use different mechanisms such as electromagnetic or acoustic actuation. Both types aim to efficiently convert liquid medication into a fine mist for inhalation, providing effective respiratory treatment for patients.</p></p>
