<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Central Chillers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air-cooled</li><li>Water-cooled</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Central chillers are classified into two main market types: air-cooled and water-cooled. Air-cooled chillers use air as the medium to dissipate heat from the refrigerant, making them suitable for locations where water availability is limited. On the other hand, water-cooled chillers use water as the cooling medium, offering higher efficiency and reliability compared to air-cooled chillers. The choice between air-cooled and water-cooled chillers depends on factors such as location, space availability, and energy efficiency requirements.</p></p>
