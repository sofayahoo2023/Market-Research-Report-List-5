<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automated Vacuum Waste Collection System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Overground</li><li>Underground</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automated Vacuum Waste Collection Systems come in two main types - Overground and Underground. Overground systems are installed above ground level, typically in residential or commercial buildings, and are connected to a central waste collection unit through a network of pipes. Underground systems, on the other hand, are built beneath the ground, mainly in urban areas, and use underground vacuum pipes to transport waste to a collection point. Both systems offer efficient waste management solutions that help reduce manual handling and improve cleanliness in public spaces.</p></p>
