<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High-Temperature Prepreg Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Autoclave Processing</li><li>Out-Of-Autoclave Processing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>High-temperature prepreg materials are commonly used in two main types of processing methods: autoclave processing and out-of-autoclave processing. Autoclave processing involves curing the material at high temperatures and pressures within an autoclave chamber, resulting in high-quality, void-free composite parts. On the other hand, out-of-autoclave processing techniques allow for curing at lower pressures and temperatures outside of an autoclave, making it a more cost-effective and time-efficient alternative. Both methods have their respective advantages and are chosen based on specific application requirements.</p></p>
