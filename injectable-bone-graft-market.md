<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Injectable Bone Graft Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Natural</li><li>Synthetic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Natural injectable bone grafts are derived from natural sources such as allografts or autografts. These grafts are harvested from human or animal donors and are minimally processed before being used in medical procedures. On the other hand, synthetic injectable bone grafts are made from synthetic materials such as ceramics, calcium phosphates, or polymers. These grafts are engineered to mimic the properties of natural bone tissue and are often used in cases where natural grafts are not available or suitable. Both types of injectable bone grafts have their own advantages and limitations, and selection depends on the specific needs of the patient.</p></p>
