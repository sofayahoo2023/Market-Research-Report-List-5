<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Magnetorquers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air-core Magnetorquer</li><li>Embedded Coil</li><li>Torquerod</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Magnetorquers are used for attitude control in satellites and spacecraft. There are three main types of magnetorquers: air-core magnetorquers, embedded coil magnetorquers, and torquerod magnetorquers. Air-core magnetorquers use a set of coils that generate magnetic fields when electrical current is applied. Embedded coil magnetorquers use coils embedded within spacecraft structures to produce magnetic fields. Torquerod magnetorquers consist of a rod-shaped core surrounded by coils that interact with the Earth's magnetic field to provide torque for attitude control.</p></p>
