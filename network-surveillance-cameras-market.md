<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Network Surveillance Cameras Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centralized IP Cameras</li><li>Decentralized IP Cameras</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Network surveillance cameras can be classified into two main types: Centralized IP Cameras and Decentralized IP Cameras. Centralized IP Cameras require a central network video recorder (NVR) to store footage and manage the cameras. Decentralized IP Cameras, on the other hand, have built-in storage capabilities and can operate independently without the need for a central NVR. Centralized IP cameras are more commonly used in large-scale surveillance systems, while decentralized IP cameras are preferred for smaller-scale applications or areas with limited network infrastructure.</p></p>
