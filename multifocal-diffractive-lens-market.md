<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Multifocal Diffractive Lens Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Diffractive Bifocal Lens</li><li>Diffractive Trifocal Lens</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The multifocal diffractive lens market includes two main types: diffractive bifocal lenses and diffractive trifocal lenses. Diffractive bifocal lenses have two distinct focal points for near and far vision, providing clear vision at both distances. On the other hand, diffractive trifocal lenses have three focal points for near, intermediate, and far vision, offering a wider range of clear vision. Both types of lenses use diffraction to split light into different focal points, allowing for improved vision at multiple distances.</p></p>
