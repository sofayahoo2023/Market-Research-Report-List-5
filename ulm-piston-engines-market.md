<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The ULM Piston Engines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>2-stroke ULM Piston Engines</li><li>4-stroke ULM Piston Engines</li></ul></p>
<p><p>ULM Piston Engines are classified into two main types based on their cycle of operation: 2-stroke and 4-stroke engines. 2-stroke engines complete a power cycle in two strokes of the piston (up and down), while 4-stroke engines require four strokes to complete a power cycle (intake, compression, power, exhaust). Both types have their own advantages and disadvantages, with 2-stroke engines typically being simpler and lighter, while 4-stroke engines tend to be more fuel-efficient and produce less emissions.</p></p>
