<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Portable Nuclear Reactor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermal-neutron Reactors</li><li>Fast-neutron Reactors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Portable nuclear reactors can be categorized into two main types based on the type of neutrons they use for fission reactions: thermal-neutron reactors and fast-neutron reactors. Thermal-neutron reactors operate by slowing down neutrons to thermal speeds before they collide with the fuel, while fast-neutron reactors use high-energy neutrons for reactions without slowing them down. Each type has its own advantages and limitations, making them suitable for different applications based on factors such as fuel efficiency, waste production, and safety considerations.</p></p>
