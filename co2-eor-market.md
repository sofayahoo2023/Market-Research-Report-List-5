<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CO2 EOR Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Industrial CO2</li><li>Natural CO2</li></ul></p>
<p><p>CO2 EOR (Enhanced Oil Recovery) market consists of two main types of CO2 sources: Industrial CO2 and Natural CO2. Industrial CO2 involves capturing carbon dioxide emitted from industrial processes such as power plants and refineries. This captured CO2 is then used for EOR purposes in oil fields. On the other hand, Natural CO2 market involves accessing naturally occurring carbon dioxide deposits underground and utilizing them for EOR operations. Both Industrial CO2 and Natural CO2 play a significant role in the CO2 EOR market by providing sustainable solutions for oil recovery.</p></p>
