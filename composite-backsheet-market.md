<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Composite Backsheet Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Fluoropolymer</li><li>Non-Fluoropolymer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Composite backsheets in the solar panel industry come in two main types - fluoropolymer and non-fluoropolymer. Fluoropolymer backsheets are known for their high performance and durability, making them ideal for harsh environmental conditions. Non-fluoropolymer backsheets are typically more cost-effective and are suitable for less demanding applications. Both types offer protection against moisture, UV radiation, and mechanical damage to the solar cells. The choice between the two types depends on the specific requirements and budget of the solar panel manufacturer.</p></p>
