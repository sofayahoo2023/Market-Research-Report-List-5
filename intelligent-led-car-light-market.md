<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intelligent LED Car Light Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Multi Beam</li><li>Single Beam</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Intelligent LED Car Light market consists of two main types: Multi Beam and Single Beam. Multi Beam lights are equipped with multiple individual LEDs that can be operated independently to adjust the distribution of light based on driving conditions, offering more precise and adaptive lighting. On the other hand, Single Beam lights have a fixed light pattern and cannot be adjusted independently. Both types aim to provide improved visibility and safety for drivers, but Multi Beam lights offer more advanced and customizable lighting solutions.</p></p>
