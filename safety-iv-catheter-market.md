<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Safety IV Catheter Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>with Wings</li><li>without Wings</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Safety IV Catheters come in two main types - with wings and without wings. IV catheters with wings have small plastic tabs on either side of the catheter that are used to secure the device in place once inserted. This design helps prevent the catheter from moving or becoming dislodged during use. On the other hand, IV catheters without wings do not have these tabs and are typically secured in place with adhesive tape. Both types are used for administering intravenous medications and fluids in a safe and effective manner.</p></p>
