<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hand Drying Machine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hand-in</li><li>Hand-under</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hand drying machines can be categorized into two main types: hand-in and hand-under. Hand-in machines require users to insert their hands into the machine where they are then dried by high-velocity air. This design is typically more compact and efficient in terms of space. In contrast, hand-under machines blow air downwards onto the user's hands as they are placed underneath the device. This design is often more hygienic as it prevents water from splashing back onto the user. Both types are commonly found in public restrooms and commercial settings.</p></p>
